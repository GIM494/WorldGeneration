# Modified Evennia

For Evennia some core engine changes needed to be made. The biggest one involved fiddling with the URL string in order to allow dynamic redirection to certain game rooms. I made this repository public within Georgia Tech, so anyone should be able to clone it in order to run games built using it.

See a brief description of the original Evennia project below.

## Evennia Description

*Evennia* is a modern library for creating [online multiplayer text
games][wikimudpage] (MUD, MUSH, MUX, MUCK, MOO etc) in pure Python. It
allows game creators to design and flesh out their ideas with great
freedom. Evennia is made available under the very friendly [BSD
license][license].
