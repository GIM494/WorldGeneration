describe "Good job! In every room, you can look at the 'Exits' to know the possible locations you can get to from your current location. The treasure in this room is the satisfaction of making progress. However, there is one last thing before I let you go. Some rooms can have items, characters, and other objects in them as well. You can get a closer look at these items by investigating them individually. Give it a shot. Try typing 'examine the scroll' or 'look at the scroll'."
